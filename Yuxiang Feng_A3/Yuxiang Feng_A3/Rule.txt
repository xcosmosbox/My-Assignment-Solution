The following are the specific scoring rules:

1.Combination points can only be obtained in the same round. For example, when the player rolls the dice in the first round,
  the six dice are ¡°5, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6¡±. Currently the player decides to keep these two dice with 5 points. 
  In the second round, he will only roll four dice. The points he got were ¡°5, 3, 3, 6¡±. 
  Currently, the player chooses to keep 5 points. Therefore, there are three ¡°5 points¡± dice in his dice dock. 
  However, these three dice are not obtained at the same time, so his score is 150 points, not 500 points.

2.Situations players may encounter in a game:
	-> 2.1 The player rolls the dice and puts at least one dice from the result. If it is unfortunate that none of 
	       them can be put on hold, then it is called FARKLE.
	-> 2.2 The player keeps rolling the dice until all six dice are put on hold, then the player can roll a new set of dice 
	       and temporarily store the scores obtained by the first six dice.
	-> 2.3 If six dice are successfully set aside, but FARKLE appears in the next round. Therefore, players will lose 
	       unsaved scores, including those in the previous group that was only temporarily saved but not actually saved.

3.Any FARKLE will lose unsaved scores and hand over the game opportunity to the next player.
