Here is an example of the game:

Player A rolls the dice once. He won the six points of "1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6". He chose to shelve point 1, 
but not point 5, because he thought that point 5 would get too few points.
	-> He rolls the remaining 5 dice. He got the five points "5, 5, 5, 3, 4".
		-> Case 1: He chose to set aside three points 5. At this point he has four dice, totaling 600scores.
				So, he chose to keep the score. The game round is passed to the next player.
		-> Case 2: He chose to set aside three points 5. He chose to continue rolling the dice.
				-> Case 2.1: He rolled the "2, 3" point. He could not set aside any dice. At this time,
					we said that he was shaken to FARKLE. The game round is passed to the next player.
				-> Case 2.2: He rolls to "1, 1", at which point he chooses to set aside all the dice. He can
					continue to roll a new set of dice to continue accumulating points. Until he
					chooses to save the score or shake to FARKLE.
